# Adversarial State Detection Framework
This is the implementation of adversarial state detection framework. It can detect adversarial states in the simulation of deep reinforcement learning environment. I provide two Atari environments, Pong and Freeway, to demonstarte that adversarial state detection framework can pinpoint adversairla states for deep reinforcement learning. I did not use argpaser, so if you want to tune parameters (such as the percentage of adversarial states), please download load the code and change the parameter in the code.

The implementation of DQN is based on: https://github.com/higgsfield/RL-Adventure
